# The Most Worthy Distinction of Pain
```
We intercepted a code! Yeah, so, this is a lot of nonsense. It's mostly words that start with
`d`, but at least we know how it was created?

We also know where the dictionary file came from:
[`CROSSWD.TXT`](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/3201/files/CROSSWD.TXT)

Note: The `CROSSWD.TXT` file can be verified with an md5 hash of
`e58eb7b851c2e78770b20c715d8f8d7b`. It starts with 1st word `aa`, and
ends with the 113809th word `zymurgy`.

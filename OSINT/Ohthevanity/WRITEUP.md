I came up with two different ways to solve this one. The first was using the keywords `mask phishing campaigns` from the problems and then set the `last update` advanced search setting to `upto a month ago` since the problem says it was published this month. It then became the top search result.

The other way of solving it was to do some research and find that vanity URLs can be used in phishing attacks and then search `vanity phishing campaigns`, it was on the first page of results. 

The date is `May 11, 2022` so in the flag would be byuctf{05-11-2022}

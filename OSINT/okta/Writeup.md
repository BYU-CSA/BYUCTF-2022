Okta? More like OkNah.

Recently, the group known as LAPSUS$ released indications they breached Microsoft & one of the Largest SSO companies, Okta. 
Some of their private conversations revealing brutally honest feelings were leaked to social media. One even hinted that in their opinion: "most of the time if you don't do anything like ____ ______, you won't be detected.". Can you find the leak and fill in the blanks?

This one takes some significant google-fu via twitter. 
The intent was not to go to telegram, hence the mention of leaking to a social media site. 
Twitter is the leading place to find leaked information, especially with Ransomware groups being hot topics at the moment.

There also existed a solution where someone in that chat also took a screeenshot but they were at a different timezone than others and so we accepted that adjusted time as well.

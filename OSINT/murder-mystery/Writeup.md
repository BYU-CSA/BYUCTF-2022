Official one is on it’s way. Essentially they need to decode the binary into `nrhpid 80002319`, which will lead them to the National Register of Historic Places site number 80002319, which is the birthplace of Jesse James. If they google Jesse James and famous inscriptions, they’ll run into the epitaph on his first grave. They can confirm that this is the right inscription with the date, which is the day he was exhumed from that grave to be buried with his wife.

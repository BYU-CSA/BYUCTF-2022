# Basic Rev Writeup
The source code for `basic_rev` has been included. The goal of the challenge is to make the participants follow the steps that the binary goes through to determine what the flag is. This could be reversing in Ghidra (inspect the decompiled code and the data segments), looking at register values in GDB for each line of code, or even finding where in memory the flag is stored and before exiting the program, printing out that memory. 

**Flag** - `byuctf{t35t_fl4g_pl3453_ign0r3}`

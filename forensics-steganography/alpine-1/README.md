In this challenge you need to find the file and its path that is giving access to the attacker. The system administrator (`root:strongpassword`) created a user for a local user, Matt Johnson (`mjohnson:hardpassword`). An attacker was able to brute force Matt's password and login. The system administrator changed Matt's password (`mjohnson:secretpassword`), however the attacker is still able to SSH into the machine. 

Provide the path and file name that is allowing the attacker to still have access (persistence): `byuctf{/full/path/to/file}`.

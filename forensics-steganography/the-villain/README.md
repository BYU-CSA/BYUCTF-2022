# The Villain

I've been hacked! Someone took a precious photo of mine and secured it in a password-protected ZIP folder. They taunted me by saying that the password is based on their personal life, but I'll never figure out who it is. I beg to differ! But all I've been able to find so far is this photo of my friend communicating with them, can you help me?
